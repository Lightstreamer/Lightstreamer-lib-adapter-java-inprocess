/**
 * Provides a default implementation of all the MetadataProvider interface
 * methods, except for getItems and getSchema. Overriding this class
 Â° may facilitate the coding of simple Metadata Adapters.<BR>
 * The class also provides implementations for old signature versions
 * of some methods (in the form of overloads of the current version) and,
 * by default, it forwards the implementations for the current signature
 * versions to the old ones, which involves discarding some arguments.
 * As a consequence, a custom Metadata Adapter inheriting from this class
 * is allowed to stick to old signature versions for its own implementations,
 * although the use of the current versions is recommended.
 * However, the restrictions related to the {@link MetadataProvider}
 * interface still hold: the custom part of the Adapter is only allowed
 * to implement at most one version for each interface method, otherwise
 * the Adapter can be refused (with the exception of notifyUser,
 * which has two current overloaded versions).
