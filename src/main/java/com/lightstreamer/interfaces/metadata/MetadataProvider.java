/**
 * Provides an interface to be implemented by a Metadata Adapter in order
 * to attach a Metadata Provider to Lightstreamer Kernel.
 * The configuration of an Adapter instance requires the following items:
 * <UL>
 * <LI> a unique identification for the instance; </LI>
 * <LI> the Adapter class name; </LI>
 * <LI> optional configuration parameters. </LI>
 * </UL>
 * A Metadata Provider is used by Lightstreamer Kernel in combination with
 * one or multiple Data Providers, uniquely associated with it.
 * The configuration is accomplished through the "adapters.xml" configuration
 * files, by which one or more "Adapter Sets" can be installed into the Server,
 * where each Adapter Set is made up of exactly one Metadata Adapter and one
 * or multiple Data Adapters.
 * <BR>A single instance of each configured Metadata Adapter is created by
 * Lightstreamer Kernel at startup, then its init method is called, providing
 * it with the configuration information. For this purpose, any Metadata
 * Adapter must provide a void constructor.
 * <BR>Note: in order to support method extensions, the Server may inspect
 * The Metadata Adapter binaries to look for methods based on old signatures.
 * For this reason, the custom part of the Adapter implementation is only
 * allowed to contain a single public overload for each interface method,
 * otherwise the Adapter can be refused (with the exception of notifyUser,
 * which has two overloaded versions).
 * But see {@link MetadataProviderAdapter} and
 * {@link com.lightstreamer.adapters.metadata.LiteralBasedProvider}
 * for special cases related to the use of these classes.
 * <BR>
 * <BR>A Metadata Provider is consulted by Lightstreamer Kernel in order
 * to manage the push Requests intended for the associated Data Providers.
 * A Metadata Provider supplies information for several different goals:
 * <UL>
 * <LI> the resolution of the Group/Schema names used in the Requests; </LI>
 * <LI> the check of the User accessibility to the requested Items; </LI>
 * <LI> the check of the resource level granted to the User. </LI>
 * <LI> the request for specific characteristics of the Items. </LI>
 * </UL>
 * Note that each Item may be supplied by one or more of the associated Data
 * Adapters, hence each client Request always references a specific Data Adapter.

     * Called by Lightstreamer Kernel to resolve an Item Group name (or Item List specification) supplied in

     * <BR>
     * <BR>Another typical case is when the same Item has different contents
     * depending on the User that is issuing the request. On the Data Adapter
     * side, different Items (one for each User) can be used; nevertheless, on
     * the client side, the same name can be specified in the subscription
     * request and the actual user-related name can be determined and returned

     * Obviously, the two above techniques can be combined, hence any

     * <BR>
     * <BR>The method should perform fast. External information needed to
     * execute it should have been previously gathered and cached by
