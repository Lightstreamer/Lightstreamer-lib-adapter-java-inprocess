     * <LI>If a value is supplied as a byte array, it will be considered
     * as an ISO-8859-1 (ISO-LATIN-1) representation of a string, so that
     * the clients will be able to receive the value as a string object.
     * A special case is that of binary representations of AMF objects,
     * which can be received by the Flex Client Library in binary form.
     * As another special case, the mandatory fields for COMMAND Mode,
     * named "key" and "command", cannot be supplied as byte arrays.</LI> 
     * <LI>If a value is supplied as a String, it will be received as an
     * equivalent string object by the client. This, however, involves
     * an internal conversion to a byte array in order to send the update;
     * this makes supplying values as String less efficient than supplying
     * them as byte arrays, though the latter method is restricted to the
     * ISO-8859-1 (ISO-LATIN-1) character set.</LI>
     * </UL>
     * Lightstreamer Kernel will call this method at most once for each Field
     * (unless events logging is enabled) and may not call this method at all
     * for some Fields. So, if performing any data conversion is required
     * in order to extract Field values, it may be convenient to do it on
     * demand rather than doing it in advance.
     *
     * @param  name  A Field name.
     * @return  a String or a byte array containing the Field value, or null.
